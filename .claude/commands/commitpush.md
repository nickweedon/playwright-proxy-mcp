# Commit and Push Command

Commit all changes and push to the remote repository.

## Steps

1. Check git status to see what files have changed
2. Review the changes with `git diff`
3. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
4. Create a commit with a descriptive message summarizing the changes
5. Push to the remote repository

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add a blank line before the body if needed
- Reference any issues being addressed
