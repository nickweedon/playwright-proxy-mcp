This will be a new major and breaking change to this MCP proxy.
The change is that it that will now, be capable of connecting to one or more 'browser pools', where a browser pool has 1 or 
more upstream playwright MCP process instances.
The idea of the pool is that all of the existing proxy MCP tools will have a new optional `browser_pool` argument that allows the 
pool to be specified and additionally an optional 'browser_instance' argument that specifies the specific process name.
The process name is numerical by default, starting from zero but is in fact a string that can be overriden
with specific env var configuration.
Also, since there are now multiple instances the whole env var system must be overhauled.
The changes to env vars are as follows:
1. The prefix will no longer be 'PLAYWRIGHT_', instead it will be 'PW_MCP_PROXY_'. This is to avoid confusion with 
   the actual env vars used by the upstream playwright MCP server.
2. A pool must always be defined for each env var and is sepearated by the prefix by a double underscore, example:
   `PW_MCP_PROXY__SESSIONLESS_ISOLATED=true`
   This will set the config value for 'isolated' on the 'SESSIONLESS' pool.
3. A pool will define the configuration for all instances of the pool and the number of instances 
   will be set by _INSTANCES. For example:
   `PW_MCP_PROXY__SESSIONLESS_INSTANCES=10`
4. All instances can be referred to by their ID which is automatically assigned, starting from 0. 
   The instance name follows the pool name and is also separated a double underscore. For example:
   `PW_MCP_PROXY__SESSIONLESS__0_BROWSER=msedge` will override the pool configuration for instance zero
   setting the browser config to 'msedge'.
5. Instances may have an alias set by the 'ALIAS' config, for example: 
   `PW_MCP_PROXY__SESSIONLESS__0_ALIAS=main_browser`
   This will not replace the '0' but will act as an additional alias that can be used to refer to the instance
   via the `browser_instance` tool argument. The alias DOES not apply to env var configuration meaning that
   even when an alies is applied, subsequent env vars must still use the numerical env var. For example:
   `PW_MCP_PROXY__SESSIONLESS__0_HEADLESS=true` NOT `PW_MCP_PROXY__SESSIONLESS__main_browser_HEADLESS=true`.
6. A pool may be marked as the 'default' pool, for example: `PW_MCP_PROXY__SESSIONLESS_IS_DEFAULT=true`.
   This will mean that when the `browser_pool` tool argument is omitted, this default will be used.
   There can only be one default defined and defining multiple should trigger a validation error.

## Pool behavior

Access to the processes of a pool will now be coordinated via a 'pool manager' which manages the 
individual proxy clients (i.e. proxy_client.py).
The pool manager will lease access to the caller allowing the upstream tool to be called.
This access will use the PyPi leasedkeyq library (https://github.com/nickweedon/leasedkeyq) to facilitate
access and leasing of the proxy_client via a blocking queue that also allows blocking dictionary access.
Each pool will have its own leasedkeyq data structure to gate access to the underlying processes (`proxy_client`s).
